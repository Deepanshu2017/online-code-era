In many online competations we have to generate very large number of prime numbers within as less time as possible so
Sieve if Eratosthenes and Sieve of Atkin are two very nice algoratimes to calculate large prime numbers in less time and
this directory contains the implementation of Sieve of Eratosthenes and Sieve of Atkin!

Sometimes we have to multiply very large number or we have to find out factorial of large numbers and handling these
large numbers in languages like Java or Python is very easy but when it comes to language like C or C++ no data-type can
hope very large numebrs so we have to use array!
