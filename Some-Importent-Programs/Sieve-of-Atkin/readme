This Logic is litte bit faster when comes to find the prime numbers of lagre range but it is not as much 
effective as Sieve of eratosthenes when it comes to find prime number of small range! ALso this mathematical
is not valid numbers under or equal to 5 so we have to explicitley wrrite these 3 prime numbers "2" "3" and "5"
