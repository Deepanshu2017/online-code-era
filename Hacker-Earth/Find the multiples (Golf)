THE PROBLEM STATEMENT
Bob is fond of the number 3. He was given n numbers and he decides to count all the multiples of 3 from the n numbers. 
You have to write a program to help Bob. 

INPUT
1. The first line of input contains the integer n.
2. Then n lines follow, each containing a positive integer a[i], 1<=i<=n.


OUTPUT
The output contains a single integer, the required count. 

CONSTRAINTS
1<=n<=10000 1<=a[i]<=10^9 

This is a golf code problem, so the correct source code with the least number of characters will be given,
more points. I have a solution of 34 characters that is the reference point. It is assigned a score of 100. 
Suppose, you submit a solution of n characters, then your score is (34/n)*100. 

There is a very good chance that you might beat this solution and score more the 100 points for the question.
